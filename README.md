# burger

## Getting Started

This is a little application that simulate a restaurant counter (or your digestive system :) ). I created this to practice front-end and back-end web development here is the [Deploy Page](https://eatdaburgerbyyuwen.herokuapp.com). Take a look!


### Prerequisites

To run the website locally please first follow the steps below

1. Clone the whole repository and get into the directory in your terminal.
2. In your terminal and in the root directory of the repository type in  `npm install`  to set up all the required modules.
3. Make sure the database setting in config/connection.js match your MySQL setting
4. Run the server.js by entering `node server.js` in the root directory. 
5. Open your browser and enter `http://localhost:3000/` as the address. Then, you can see the page!

## How to use it

- Click the `Devour it!` button to eat the burger and it will be moved to your **Belly**;
- Write the name of the burger you want to eat in the below textarea and click the `Make a new burger` button below. You will be served a new burger in **Mouth**! Yeah~
